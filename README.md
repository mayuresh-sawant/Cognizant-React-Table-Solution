## Cognizant - Solution For Hacker Rank React Table Problem

https://s3.amazonaws.com/istreet-assets/HTgl-3dj2ua1ETn6zmsm6Q/leaderboard.gif


I developed the solution on my local IDE without using HackerRank recommended structure.

With this implementation of mine, some of the test cases are failing in HackerRank. 

The program compiles and runs successfully and the output is as expected in the problem.


### Step to run the application:

1) Clone the git repository into your local machine  - https://github.com/mayuresh-sawant/Cognizant-React-Table-Solution.git
2) Open the folder in any IDE eg - Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ
3) Use 'npm install' to load dependencies
4) Use 'npm run start' to run the application
5) 'http://localhost:3000/' view the table and sorting functionality
